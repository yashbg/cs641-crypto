### Assignment 5
To Decipher the AES we simply run [Decipher.ipynb](Decipher.ipynb) file cell by cell to obtain the deciphered password, 
We also have a [script.sh](script.sh) file which is called from the [Decipher.ipynb](Decipher.ipynb) file. 

Note:  
You can also run the notebook using the command `make decipher`, but you will not be able to see the outputs. So we recommend you to simply run the jupyter notebook yourself.
