Level you want to start at: 



	The rumbling sound is very loud here. It is coming from
	your right side. A cold blast of air hits you sending
	shivers up your spine. You look in that direction. 
	There is a large opening on the right from where the 
	sound and the air is coming from. There is a fair amount
	of light also coming from that direction (you realize that
	you have not lighted a matchstick and still you can see).
	There is another door, with a panel nearby, to your left 
	which is closed. The chamber is rocky and cold. Another 
	blast of air hits you from your right and you shiver again.

	You come up to the closed door and look at the glass panel ...
	... there is nothing written on it!!

	As you wonder what is happening here, you hear the spirit whispering
	in your ears ...

	"This is a magical screen. You can whisper something close to the
	screen and the corresponding coded text would appear on it after a while. 
	So go ahead and try to break the code! The code used for this is 
	a 4-round DES, so it should be easy for you!! Er wait ... maybe it is
	a 6-round DES ... sorry, my memory has blurred after so many years.
	But I am sure you can break even 6-round DES easily. A 10-round DES
	is a different matter, but this one surely is not 10-round ...
	(long pause) ... at least that is what I remember. One thing that I
	surely remember is that you can see the coded password by whispering 'password'.
	There was something funny about how the text appears, two letters for one
	byte or something like that. I do not recall more than that.
	I am sure you can figure it out though ..."

Slowly, a new text starts appearing on the screen. It reads ...

	The text in the screen vanishes!
