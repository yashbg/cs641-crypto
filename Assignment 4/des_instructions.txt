You come up to the closed door and look at the glass panel ...
... there is nothing written on it!!

As you wonder what is happening here, you hear the spirit whispering
in your ears ...

"This is a magical screen. You can whisper something close to the
screen and the corresponding coded text would appear on it after a while. 
So go ahead and try to break the code! The code used for this is 
a 4-round DES, so it should be easy for you!! Er wait ... maybe it is
a 6-round DES ... sorry, my memory has blurred after so many years.
But I am sure you can break even 6-round DES easily. A 10-round DES
is a different matter, but this one surely is not 10-round ...
(long pause) ... at least that is what I remember. One thing that I
surely remember is that you can see the coded password by whispering 'password'.
There was something funny about how the text appears, two letters for one
byte or something like that. I do not recall more than that.
I am sure you can figure it out though ..."
