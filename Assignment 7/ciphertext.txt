You see the following written on the panel:

22 0 104 11 116 23 34 8 86 85 104 36 32 34 115 63 87 19 38 29 4 36 6 9 99 89 83 10 80 42 27 110 

As you wonder what do these numbers mean, you hear a whisper in your ears ...
"I am so happy that he went away without noticing me. He is the one who bound
me to the hole. Oh, I was so scared that he will notice me!

You must be wondering about these numbers. These are hash values of your password
which is made of letters between 'f' and 'u'. Also, the letters in the password are
in alphabetic order. For hashing, your password is viewed as a sequence
of numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_m in the field F_{127}. The ith number of the hashed
sequence equals x_1^{i-1} + x_2^{i-1} + ... + x_m^{i-1}. As you can see, there are
32 such numbers for i = 1 to 32."
